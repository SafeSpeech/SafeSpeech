data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_gka_arctic/wav/arctic_a0095.wav|9|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_rms_arctic/wav/arctic_a0030.wav|14|I had faith in them.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_bdl_arctic/wav/arctic_a0036.wav|5|She turned in at the hotel.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_clb_arctic/wav/arctic_a0025.wav|6|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_ahw_arctic/wav/arctic_a0042.wav|1|How could he explain his possession of the sketch."
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_jmk_arctic/wav/arctic_a0056.wav|10|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.

data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_slt_arctic/wav/arctic_a0046.wav|17|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_jmk_arctic/wav/arctic_a0057.wav|10|I have no idea, replied Philip.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_clb_arctic/wav/arctic_a0042.wav|6|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_slp_arctic/wav/arctic_a0049.wav|16|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_lnh_arctic/wav/arctic_a0066.wav|13|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.

data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_lnh_arctic/wav/arctic_a0062.wav|13|The men stared into each other's face.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_aew_arctic/wav/arctic_a0077.wav|0|It is the fire, partly, she said.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_rxr_arctic/wav/arctic_a0029.wav|15|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_aew_arctic/wav/arctic_a0059.wav|0|His immaculate appearance was gone.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_aup_arctic/wav/arctic_a0081.wav|2|What if she did not come to the rock.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_eey_arctic/wav/arctic_a0062.wav|7|The men stared into each other's face.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_bdl_arctic/wav/arctic_a0027.wav|5|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_bdl_arctic/wav/arctic_a0003.wav|5|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_slp_arctic/wav/arctic_a0065.wav|16|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_ksp_arctic/wav/arctic_a0023.wav|11|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_slt_arctic/wav/arctic_a0053.wav|17|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.

data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_jmk_arctic/wav/arctic_a0080.wav|10|What if Jeanne failed him.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_ahw_arctic/wav/arctic_a0074.wav|1|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him."
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_bdl_arctic/wav/arctic_a0048.wav|5|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_gka_arctic/wav/arctic_a0039.wav|9|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_clb_arctic/wav/arctic_a0058.wav|6|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_clb_arctic/wav/arctic_a0085.wav|6|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.

data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_clb_arctic/wav/arctic_a0096.wav|6|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_axb_arctic/wav/arctic_a0018.wav|4|There was a change now.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_ljm_arctic/wav/arctic_a0034.wav|12|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_rms_arctic/wav/arctic_a0021.wav|14|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_jmk_arctic/wav/arctic_a0094.wav|10|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.

data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_bdl_arctic/wav/arctic_a0072.wav|5|But who was Eileen's double.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_jmk_arctic/wav/arctic_a0043.wav|10|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_slp_arctic/wav/arctic_a0018.wav|16|There was a change now.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_rxr_arctic/wav/arctic_a0004.wav|15|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_clb_arctic/wav/arctic_a0002.wav|6|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.

data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_clb_arctic/wav/arctic_a0078.wav|6|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_ksp_arctic/wav/arctic_a0095.wav|11|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_rms_arctic/wav/arctic_a0006.wav|14|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.

data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_ljm_arctic/wav/arctic_a0005.wav|12|Will we ever forget it.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_aup_arctic/wav/arctic_a0087.wav|2|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.

data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_aup_arctic/wav/arctic_a0013.wav|2|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_lnh_arctic/wav/arctic_a0054.wav|13|There was nothing on the rock.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_slp_arctic/wav/arctic_a0087.wav|16|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.

data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_rxr_arctic/wav/arctic_a0083.wav|15|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_gka_arctic/wav/arctic_a0037.wav|9|I was the only one who remained sitting.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_ksp_arctic/wav/arctic_a0064.wav|11|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_jmk_arctic/wav/arctic_a0063.wav|10|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_awb_arctic/wav/arctic_a0047.wav|3|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_axb_arctic/wav/arctic_a0023.wav|4|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.

data/real/CMU_ARCTIC/cmu_us_bdl_arctic/wav/arctic_a0070.wav|5|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
